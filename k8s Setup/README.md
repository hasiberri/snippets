# K8s Setup

Lainotik Bigdata/ML IIOT platform can work with any Kubernetes cluster, but it is necessary for the kubernetes provider to setup the kubernetes cluster with the right resources/nodes setup and configuration.

This setup includes some of this points:

* Secure Lainotik Platform access to the kubernetes cluster
* Proper labelling of the cluster nodes to define where the Lainotik services are deployed
* Storage management
