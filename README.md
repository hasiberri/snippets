# Lainotik Documentation and Snippets

This repo contains snippeds and the documentation related to the use of the Lainotik Bigdata/ML SAAS platform. Its goal is to provide all the information required to make an efficient use of the Lainotik Bigdata IIOT platform.

Lainotik provides BigData/ML IIOT SAAS services on Kubernetes (also referred as K8s), therefore it can work with any Kubernetes provider:

Scaling of the bigdata services is facilitated by Lainotik deploying automatically the requested resources with "just one click", allowing the management of the resources to cover the business needs at the lower cost.

Simplicity with total Bigdata/ML services is the aim of Lainotik.
